**Description:**

The **Fancy Book Cover** block enhances your content with a dynamic 3D representation of a book cover, complete with customizable animations triggered by mouse hover.

Are you looking to promote a book or e-book? Or perhaps you want to boost engagement with a lead magnet download? Incorporating an eye-catching 3D cover can significantly increase visitor interaction and conversions.

The plugin supports three cover sizes: *small*, *medium*, and *large*. Minimum image dimensions are *66 x 100 pixels* for small, *133 x 200 pixels* for medium, and *200 x 300 pixels* for large. Accepted image formats include JPG, GIF, PNG, and SVG (if supported by your WordPress installation) for sharp, detailed covers.
